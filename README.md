## THE FIZZBUZZ CHALLENGE

The FIZZBUZZ challenge is popular all over the world. It is as follows: print all numbers from 1 to 100. If the number is divisible by 3, print *FIZZ* instead of the number. If the number is divisible by 5, print *BUZZ*. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print *FIZZBUZZ*. The output looks like this:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
